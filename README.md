# Personal Profile Page (Glint)
## General Inforamtion
This profile page contain my basic information and work experience,including academic and industrial. In the meantime, I include my personal projects and hobby inside the page to provide additional information about myself. I decide to make the UI design similar with Linkdin not only to prove my confidence in replciating a design but considering this type of format for profiling is clean and efficient to see a person's working experience base on the requirement.
